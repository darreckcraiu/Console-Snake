# Console-Snake
Play the classic game of Snake but with local multiplayer versus action (all in your computer's terminal). 
Death match ends with the last player standing while Length Battle plays with respawn on and ends when a player reaches the target length.
Many things are adjustable by constants in a config file, i.e. snake and snakefood style and color, ASCII for the grid borders and boxes, game speed and number of players.
Made from scratch with C++ and Visual Studio 2022. Some of the core logic, such as that which is used to take user input and the snake's body being represented by a circular array
were taken from the internet after I tried and realized the great performance difference they made compared to my original conceptions of the logic.
